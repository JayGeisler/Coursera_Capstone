Edmonton Metro Project 

By Jayden Geisler

Use data to map out where a new LRT line should go in Edmonton. I used income and education data for each neighbourhood. Use K-means to categorize neighbourhoods and then made a path algorithm to link them.  

All data is from the City of Edmonton open data portal.
