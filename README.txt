Edmonton Metro Project 

By Jayden Geisler

In this project I attempt to map out new train lines in the city of Edmonton based on education and income of each neighborhood in the city of Edmonton as well as venue popularity values.  To get the venue popularity I use the foursquare API.

All Edmonton data is form the city of Edmonton open data portal.
